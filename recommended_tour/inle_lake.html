		<h2>Inle</h2>

		<p>Inle Lake, the second largest in Myanmar is located in Nyaungshwe Township of Taunggyi District of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar (Burma). The lake drains through the Nam Pilu (Balu Chaung) on its southern end. And also there is a hot spring on it northwestern shore. Inle Lake is a major tourist attraction, and a number of festivals occur.

		In Inle Lake, there are proximately 70,000 of people living in four cities bordering the lake, in numerous small villages along the lake’s shore and on the lake itself. The population consists mainly of Intha with a mix of other Shan, Pa-O, Danu, Kayah, Burmese, Danaw and Taumgyo ethnicities. Transportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder inboard diesel engines. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants, making it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds.</p>
